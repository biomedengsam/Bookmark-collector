# Bookmark-collector
When I decided to learn  programming I started reading about the subject and I found a lot of resources online.

So, I started to bookmark the subjects, articles, tutorial that I found useful to look at them later. But I lost track of a lot of these resources.

I had different bookmarks on different social media platforms, websites I had bookmarks on my phone bookmarks on my laptop ....everywhere.

Then the idea for the project came I designed a web application to collect any useful bookmark form anywhere I find. In this app you can

* Login or create a new account
* Create a new bookmark
* Add the link for the bookmark
* Add a description
* Add any personal notes or summary for that bookmark
* Update any existing bookmark
* Delete any bookmark
* Search for bookmark depending on the subject
* Change user password
